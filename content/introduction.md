# Functional Programming  

think in sets


## Pure Functions

Everything in set A maps into set B

* Output is determined by the input
* Evaluating an expression always results in the same answer
* So we can **inline** the function call or **factor** it out.
* We can substitute a variable for the expression itâ€™s bound to, or introduce a new variable to factor out common sub-expressions. This is called **referential transparency**.
